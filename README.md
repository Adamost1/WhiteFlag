# Methods to implement 
1. Void Methods
	* addLast()
	* addFirst()
2. Generic Object Returning Methods
	*removeLast()
	*removeFirst()
	*peekFirst()
	*peekLast()
	*getFirst()
	*getLast()
3. Primitive Returning Methods
	*isEmpty()
# To Do List
	* As of 2018-04-18 we plan to get our addLast() and addFirst() methods done by implementing isEmpty() first as different operations are performed if a deque is empty.
