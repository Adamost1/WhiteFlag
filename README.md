# Methods to implement 
1. Void Methods
	* addLast()
	* addFirst()
2. Generic Object Returning Methods
	* removeLast()
	* removeFirst()
	* peekFirst()
	* peekLast()
	* getFirst()
	* getLast()
3. Primitive Returning Methods
	* isEmpty()
# To Do List
	* As of 2018-04-18 we plan to get our addLast() and addFirst() methods done by implementing isEmpty() first as different operations are performed if a deque is empty.
# Development Plan
Implement methods around isEmpty starting with the adding methods in order to construct our basic deque. After that, we will implement the peek and the get methods and move 
onto remove elements from deque. Then, we will figure out what more methods we need to implement in order to have a functional deque that allows for the best usage of it.
